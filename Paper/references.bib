	abstract = {Summary
Much biomedical research is observational. The reporting of such research is often inadequate, which hampers the assessment of its strengths and weaknesses and of a study's generalisability. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) initiative developed recommendations on what should be included in an accurate and complete report of an observational study. We defined the scope of the recommendations to cover three main study designs: cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies. We convened a 2-day workshop in September, 2004, with methodologists, researchers, and journal editors to draft a checklist of items. This list was subsequently revised during several meetings of the coordinating group and in e-mail discussions with the larger group of STROBE contributors, taking into account empirical evidence and methodological considerations. The workshop and the subsequent iterative process of consultation and revision resulted in a checklist of 22 items (the STROBE statement) that relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of articles. 18 items are common to all three study designs and four are specific for cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional studies. A detailed explanation and elaboration document is published separately and is freely available on the websites of PLoS Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine, and Epidemiology. We hope that the STROBE statement will contribute to improving the quality of reporting of observational studies.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To estimate the national prevalence and incidence of adults consulting for a shoulder condition and to investigate patterns of diagnosis, treatment, consultation and referral 3 yr after initial presentation.
METHODS: Prevalence and incidence rates were estimated for 658469 patients aged 18 and over in the year 2000 using a primary care database, the IMS Disease Analyzer-Mediplus UK. A cohort of 9215 incident cases was followed-up prospectively for 3 yr beyond the initial consultation.
RESULTS: The annual prevalence and incidence of people consulting for a shoulder condition was 2.36\% [95\% confidence interval (CI) 2.32-2.40\%] and 1.47\% (95\% CI 1.44-1.50\%), respectively. Prevalence increased linearly with age whilst incidence peaked at around 50 yr then remained static at around 2\%. Around half of the incident cases consulted once only, while 13.6\% were still consulting with a shoulder problem during the third year of follow-up. During the 3 yr following initial presentation, 22.4\% of patients were referred to secondary care, 30.8\% were prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and 10.6\% were given an injection by their general practitioner (GP). GPs tended to use a limited number of generalized codes when recording a diagnosis; just five of 426 possible Read codes relating to shoulder conditions accounted for 74.6\% of the diagnoses of new cases recorded by GPs.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of people consulting for shoulder problems in primary care is substantially lower than community-based estimates of shoulder pain. Most referrals occur within 3 months of initial presentation, but only a minority of patients are referred to orthopaedic specialists or rheumatologists. GPs may lack confidence in applying precise diagnoses to shoulder conditions.},

	abstract = {Despite the popularity of surgical repair of rotator cuff tears, literature regarding the indications for and timing of surgery are sparse. We performed a systematic review of the literature to investigate factors influencing the decision to surgically repair symptomatic, full-thickness rotator cuff tears. Specifically, how do demographic variables, duration of symptoms, timing of surgery, physical examination findings, and size of tear affect treatment outcome and indications for surgery? We reviewed the best available evidence, which offers some guidelines for surgical decision making. Variables suggest earlier surgical intervention may be needed in the setting of weakness and substantial functional disability. With regard to demographic variables, the evidence is unclear regarding their association with treatment outcome. However, older chronological age does not seem to portend a worse outcome. Pending worker's compensation claims does seem to negatively affect treatment results. Further research is required to define the indications for surgery for full thickness rotator cuff tears. However, the design and conduct of an ethical study to obtain Level I evidence on this issue will be a major challenge.

Common shoulder disorders exhibit similar clinical features, and the lack of consensus on diagnostic criteria and concordance in clinical assessment complicates treatment choices.3 w2-w5 This review proposes an evidence based approach using a simplified classification of shoulder problems, incorporating diagnostic techniques applicable to a primary care consultation and a “red flag” system to identify potentially serious disease.

	abstract = {Objectives To illustrate the need for better evaluation of surgical procedures, we investigated the use and cost of subacromial decompression in England over the last decade compared with other countries and explored how this related to the conduct and outcomes of randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials.
Design Longitudinal observational study using Hospital Episode Statistics linked to Payment by Results tariffs in England, 2007/2008 to 2016/2017.
Setting Hospital care in England; Finland; New York State, USA; Florida State, USA and Western Australia.
Participants Patients with subacromial shoulder pain.
Interventions Subacromial decompression.
Main outcome measures National procedure rates, costs and variation between clinical commissioning groups in England.
Results Without robust clinical evidence, the use of subacromial decompression in England increased by 91\% from 15 112 procedures (30 per 100 000 population) in 2007/2008, to 28 802 procedures (52 per 100 000 population) in 2016/2017, costing over £125 million per year. Rates of use of subacromial decompression are even higher internationally: Finland (131 per 100 000 in 2011), Florida State (130 per 100 000 in 2007), Western Australia (115 per 100 000 in 2013) and New York State (102 per 100 000 in 2006). Two randomised placebo-controlled trials have recently (2018) shown the procedure to be no more effective than placebo or conservative approaches. Health systems appear unable to avoid the rapid widespread use of procedures of unknown effectiveness, and methods for ceasing ineffective treatments are under-developed.
Conclusions Without good evidence, nearly 30 000 subacromial decompression procedures have been commissioned each year in England, costing over £1 billion since 2007/2008. Even higher rates of procedures are carried out in countries with less regulated health systems. High quality randomised trials need to be initiated before widespread adoption of promising operative procedures to avoid overtreatment and wasted resources, and methods to prevent or desist the use of ineffective procedures need to be expedited.},

INTERVENTIONS--Arthroscopic subacromial decompression performed by two experienced surgeons; exercise regimen over three to six months supervised by one experienced physiotherapist; or 12 sessions of detuned soft laser treatment over six weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Change in the overall Neer shoulder score (pain during previous week and blinded evaluation of function and range of movement by one clinician) after six months. RESULTS--No differences were found between the three groups in duration of sick leave and daily intake of analgesics. After six months the difference in improvement in overall Neer score between surgery and supervised exercises was 4.0 (95\% confidence interval -2 to 11) and 2.0 (-1.4 to 5.4) after adjustment for sex. The condition improved significantly compared with placebo in both groups given the active treatments. Treatment costs were higher for those given surgery (720 pounds v 390 pounds).

The main outcome measure was self-reported pain on a visual analogue scale of 0 to 10 at 24 months, measured on the 134 patients (66 in the exercise group and 68 in the combined treatment group) for whom endpoint data were available. An intention-to-treat analysis disclosed an improvement in both groups but without statistically significant difference in outcome between the groups (p = 0.65). The combined treatment was considerably more costly. Arthroscopic acromioplasty provides no clinically important effects over a structured and supervised exercise programme alone in terms of subjective outcome or cost-effectiveness when measured at 24 months.

METHODS: Randomised controlled trial with 12 months' follow up in a hospital setting. Ninety consecutive patients aged 18 to 55 years were enrolled. Symptom duration was between six months and three years. All fulfilled a set of diagnostic criteria for rotator cuff disease, including a positive impingement sign. Patients were randomised either to arthroscopic subacromial decompression, or to physiotherapy with exercises aiming at strengthening the stabilisers and decompressors of the shoulder. Outcome was shoulder function as measured by the Constant score and a pain and dysfunction score. "Intention to treat" analysis was used, with comparison of means and control of confounding variables by general equation estimation analysis.
RESULTS: Of 90 patients enrolled, 84 completed follow up (41 in the surgery group, 43 in the training group). The mean Constant score at baseline was 34.8 in the training group and 33.7 in the surgery group. After 12 months the mean scores improved to 57.0 and 52.7, respectively, the difference being non-significant. No group differences in mean pain and dysfunction score improvement were found.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment of rotator cuff syndrome with subacromial impingement was not superior to physiotherapy with training. Further studies are needed to qualify treatment choice decisions, and it is recommended that samples are stratified according to disability level.},

We did a study to assess its effectiveness and to investigate the mechanism for surgical decompression.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}We did a multicentre, randomised, pragmatic, parallel group, placebo-controlled, three-group trial at 32 hospitals in the UK with 51 surgeons. Participants were patients who had subacromial pain for at least 3 months with intact rotator cuff tendons, were eligible for arthroscopic surgery, and had previously completed a non-operative management programme that included exercise therapy and at least one steroid injection. Exclusion criteria included a full-thickness torn rotator cuff. We randomly assigned participants (1:1:1) to arthroscopic subacromial decompression, investigational arthroscopy only, or no treatment (attendance of one reassessment appointment with a specialist shoulder clinician 3 months after study entry, but no intervention). Arthroscopy only was a placebo as the essential surgical element (bone and soft tissue removal) was omitted. We did the randomisation with a computer-generated minimisation system. In the surgical intervention groups, patients were not told which type of surgery they were receiving (to ensure masking). Patients were followed up at 6 months and 1 year after randomisation; surgeons coordinated their waiting lists to schedule surgeries as close as possible to randomisation. The primary outcome was the Oxford Shoulder Score (0 [worst] to 48 [best]) at 6 months, analysed by intention to treat. The sample size calculation was based upon a target difference of 4·5 points (SD 9·0).

At 6 months, data for the Oxford Shoulder Score were available for 90 patients assigned to decompression, 94 to arthroscopy, and 90 to no treatment. Mean Oxford Shoulder Score did not differ between the two surgical groups at 6 months (decompression mean 32·7 points [SD 11·6] \textit{vs} arthroscopy mean 34·2 points [9·2]; mean difference −1·3 points (95\% CI −3·9 to 1·3, p=0·3141).

The findings question the value of this operation for these indications, and this should be communicated to patients during the shared treatment decision-making process.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Funding{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Arthritis Research UK, the National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, and the Royal College of Surgeons (England).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Objective To assess the efficacy of arthroscopic subacromial decompression (ASD) by comparing it with diagnostic arthroscopy, a placebo surgical intervention, and with a non-operative alternative, exercise therapy, in a more pragmatic setting.
Design Multicentre, three group, randomised, double blind, sham controlled trial.
Setting Orthopaedic departments at three public hospitals in Finland.
Participants 210 patients with symptoms consistent with shoulder impingement syndrome, enrolled from 1 February 2005 with two year follow-up completed by 25 June 2015.
Interventions ASD, diagnostic arthroscopy (placebo control), and exercise therapy.
Main outcome measures Shoulder pain at rest and on arm activity (visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 to 100, with 0 denoting no pain), at 24 months. The threshold for minimal clinically important difference was set at 15.
Results In the primary intention to treat analysis (ASD versus diagnostic arthroscopy), no clinically relevant between group differences were seen in the two primary outcomes at 24 months (mean change for ASD 36.0 at rest and 55.4 on activity; for diagnostic arthroscopy 31.4 at rest and 47.5 on activity). The observed mean difference between groups (ASD minus diagnostic arthroscopy) in pain VAS were −4.6 (95\% confidence interval −11.3 to 2.1) points (P=0.18) at rest and −9.0 (−18.1 to 0.2) points (P=0.054) on arm activity. No between group differences were seen between the ASD and diagnostic arthroscopy groups in the secondary outcomes or adverse events. In the secondary comparison (ASD versus exercise therapy), statistically significant differences were found in favour of ASD in the two primary outcomes at 24 months in both VAS at rest (−7.5, −14.0 to −1.0, points; P=0.023) and VAS on arm activity (−12.0, −20.9 to −3.2, points; P=0.008), but the mean differences between groups did not exceed the pre-specified minimal clinically important difference. Of note, this ASD versus exercise therapy comparison is not only confounded by lack of blinding but also likely to be biased in favour of ASD owing to the selective removal of patients with likely poor outcome from the ASD group, without comparable exclusions from the exercise therapy group.
Conclusions In this controlled trial involving patients with a shoulder impingement syndrome, arthroscopic subacromial decompression provided no benefit over diagnostic arthroscopy at 24 months.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate national trends in the surgical setting and hospital costs of shoulder arthroscopy and rotator cuff repair (RCR) using the Florida State surgical database and national inpatient database.
METHODS: In part I we analyzed population-adjusted shifts in RCR technique (arthroscopic v open) in the Florida surgical database from 2000-2007 and quantified the procedural codes associated with arthroscopic and open RCR. In part II we analyzed the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database from 2001-2009 for the total number of inpatient RCRs, the inpatient hospital type (rural, urban non-teaching, or urban teaching), and the cost.
RESULTS: Part I showed a 163\% increase in outpatient procedures in Florida, with a 353\% increase in arthroscopic RCRs. There was a concurrent decrease in open RCRs; however, the overall trend was a 2-fold increase in total RCRs. Associated procedures such as subacromial decompression, distal clavicle resection, and extensive glenohumeral debridement increased by 440\%, 589\%, and 1,253\%, respectively. Part II showed an overall 58.8\% decrease in inpatient RCRs that was similar across all hospital settings, with an increase in RCR-associated hospital charges by 144.9\%, whereas hospital costs only increased by 85.2\%.
CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms a shift toward arthroscopic RCR and associated procedures in the outpatient setting. The increased financial cost partly explains the shift; nevertheless, future studies are needed to further examine national trends.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study examining RCR trends by hospital type, cost, and setting further elucidates how orthopaedic surgery practice is evolving with the implementation of arthroscopic RCR in the past decade.},

	abstract = {Background: 
        Acromioplasty is considered a technically simple procedure but has become controversial with regard to its indications and therapeutic value.
        Methods: 
        Two complementary databases were used to ascertain the frequency of acromioplasty over a recent span of time. In Part A, the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) ambulatory surgery database was searched from 1996 to 2006 to identify all ambulatory surgery acromioplasties as well as all orthopaedic ambulatory surgery procedures. In Part B, the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS) database was searched from 1999 to 2008 to identify all arthroscopic acromioplasties as well as all orthopaedic procedures.
        Results: 
        Part A revealed that in 1996 there were 5571 acromioplasties in New York State, representing a population incidence of 30.0 per 100,000. In 2006 there were 19,743 acromioplasties, representing a population incidence of 101.9 per 100,000. Over these eleven years, the volume of acromioplasties increased by 254.4\%, compared with only a 78.3\% increase in the volume of all orthopaedic ambulatory surgery procedures. In 2006, as compared with 1996, patients were 2.4 times more likely to have an acromioplasty compared with all other orthopaedic ambulatory procedures (p {\textless} 0.0001). Part B revealed that, in 1999, a mean of 2.6 arthroscopic acromioplasties were reported per candidate for Board certification. In 2008 a mean of 6.3 arthroscopic acromioplasties per candidate were reported. Over these ten years, the mean number of arthroscopic acromioplasties reported increased by 142.3\%, compared with only a 13.0\% increase in the mean number of all orthopaedic surgery procedures. In 2008, as compared with 1999, candidates were 2.2 times more likely to report an arthroscopic acromioplasty compared with all other orthopaedic procedures (p {\textless} 0.0001).
        Conclusions: 
        There has been a substantial increase in the overall volume and the population-based incidence of acromioplasties in recent years on both the state and national levels in the United States. The reasons for this increase have yet to be determined and are likely multifactorial, with patient-based, surgeon-based, and systems-based factors all playing a role.},

	abstract = {Background/Aims
Electronic medical records (EMR) and claims data offer two potential data sources for researchers to examine healthcare utilization patterns and cost of care. In particular, combining the clinical and epidemiological variables typically available in EMR with cost information available in the claims data is not only intuitively sensible but also increasingly more feasible with growing standardization of EMR across healthcare delivery systems.

Methods
In this study, we compare EMR and claims data within a cohort of rheumatoid arthritis patients who received care from Geisinger Health System and had concurrent Geisinger Health Plan (GHP) coverage. We also develop a cost “imputation” method to obtain GHP claims-based cost estimates within EMR even for those who did not have GHP coverage.

Results
EMR-based estimated means of total cost of care and utilizations tend to substantially underestimate the total cost of care. In particular, EMR substantially understates emergency department (ED) visits [4\% (125 of 3,131) in EMR vs. 11.2\% (352 of 3,131) in claims], X-rays [4\% (125 of 3,131) vs. 22\% (689 of 3,131)], and CT scans [5.1\% (160 of 3,131) vs. 7.3\% (229 of 3,131)]. Use of biologic agents appear to be slightly higher in EMR than in claims [7.2\% (226 of 3,131) vs. 6.7\% (210 of 3,131)], although the difference is not statistically significant. The correlation between log-transformed EMR-based cost of care and log-transformed claims-based cost of care was modest (R2 = 0.81).

Conclusions
The findings confirm that there is significant disagreement between EMR and claims data and suggest that each represent a different set of “reality.” The main source of such discrepancies between EMR and claims appears to be missing utilization of certain types of care in EMR. In particular, discrepancies seem greater for the types of services for which patients have more alternative choices in the area. Claims data reflects health plan’s coverage decisions and utilization management, while EMR reflects clinicians’ decisions and practice patterns. Thus, researchers should carefully consider which “reality” they are interested in capturing in their analysis. Lastly, the fact that both EMR and claims are collected for clinical and administrative purposes, not for research purposes, must be emphasized.},

	abstract = {AIMS: Our aim, using English Hospital Episode Statistics data before during and after the Distal Radius Acute Fracture Fixation Trial (DRAFFT), was to assess whether the results of the trial affected clinical practice.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were grouped into six month intervals from July 2005 to December 2014. All patient episodes in the National Health Service involving emergency surgery for an isolated distal radial fracture were included.
RESULTS: Clinical practice in England had not changed in the five years before DRAFFT: 75\% of patients were treated with plate fixation versus 12\% with Kirschner (K)-wires. After the publication of the trial, the proportion of patients having K-wire fixation rose to 42\% with a concurrent fall in the proportion having fixation with a plate to 48\%. The proportion of 'other' procedures stayed the same.
TAKE HOME MESSAGE: It appears that surgeons in the United Kingdom do change their practice in response to large, pragmatic, multicentre clinical trials in musculoskeletal trauma.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To compare the clinical effectiveness of Kirschner wire fixation with locking plate fixation for patients with a dorsally displaced fracture of the distal radius.
DESIGN: A multicentre two arm parallel group assessor blind randomised controlled trial with 1:1 treatment allocation.
SETTING: 18 trauma centres in the United Kingdom.
PARTICIPANTS: 461 adults with a dorsally displaced fracture of the distal radius within 3 cm of the radiocarpal joint that required surgical fixation. Patients were excluded if the surgeon thought that the surface of the wrist joint was so badly displaced it required open reduction.
INTERVENTIONS: Kirschner wire fixation: wires are passed through the skin over the dorsal aspect of the distal radius and into the bone to hold the fracture in the correct anatomical position. Locking plate fixation: a locking plate is applied through an incision over the volar (palm) aspect of the wrist and secured to the bone with fixed angle locking screws.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: validated patient rated wrist evaluation (PRWE). This rates wrist function in two (equally weighted) sections concerning the patient's experience of pain and disability to give a score out of 100.
SECONDARY OUTCOMES: disabilities of arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH) score, the EuroQol (EQ-5D), and complications related to the surgery.
RESULTS: The baseline characteristics of the two groups were well balanced, and over 90\% of patients completed follow-up. The wrist function of both groups of patients improved by 12 months. There was no clinically relevant difference in the patient rated wrist score at three, six, or 12 months (difference in favour of the plate group was -1.3, 95\% confidence interval -4.5 to 1.8; P=0.40). Nor was there a clinically relevant difference in health related quality of life or the number of complications in each group.
CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to the existing literature, and against the rapidly increasing use of locking plate fixation, this trial found no difference in functional outcome in patients with dorsally displaced fractures of the distal radius treated with Kirschner wires or volar locking plates. Kirschner wire fixation, however, is cheaper and quicker to perform.

	abstract = {Objective To determine the benefits and harms of subacromial decompression surgery in adult patients with subacromial pain syndrome lasting for more than 3 months.
Design Systematic review with meta-analysis.
Main outcome measures Pain, physical function and health-related quality of life.
Data sources Systematic searches for benefits and harms were conducted to 23 July 2018 in MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Physiotherapy Evidence Database, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and Health Technology Assessment.
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Randomised controlled trials comparing subacromial decompression surgery for subacromial pain syndrome with any other treatment(s). For harms, we included prospective cohort studies.
Review methods Two reviewers independently determined eligibility, extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias of eligible studies. Thirty patients seeking primary or outpatient care for subacromial pain syndrome and a parallel guideline committee (BMJ Rapid Recommendations) provided input regarding systematic review design and interpretation.
Results There was high certainty evidence of no additional benefit of subacromial decompression surgery over placebo surgery in reducing pain at 1 year following surgery (mean difference [MD] −0.26, 95\% CI −0.84 to 0.33, minimally important difference [MID] 1.5) or improving physical function at 1–2 years (MD 2.8, 95\% CI −1.4 to 6.9, MID 8.3). There was moderate certainty evidence for no additional benefit of subacromial decompression surgery on health-related quality of life at 1 year (MD −0.03 points, 95\% CI −0.11 to 0.06, MID 0.07). There was moderate certainty evidence for six serious harms per 1000 (95\% CI 5 to 7) patients undergoing subacromial decompression.
Conclusion Subacromial decompression surgery provided no important benefit compared with placebo surgery or exercise therapy, and probably carries a small risk of serious harms.

	abstract = {Clinical question Do adults with atraumatic shoulder pain for more than 3 months diagnosed as subacromial pain syndrome (SAPS), also labelled as rotator cuff disease, benefit from subacromial decompression surgery? This guideline builds on to two recent high quality trials of shoulder surgery.
Current practice SAPS is the common diagnosis for shoulder pain with several first line treatment options, including analgesia, exercises, and injections. Surgeons frequently perform arthroscopic subacromial decompression for prolonged symptoms, with guidelines providing conflicting recommendations.
Recommendation The guideline panel makes a strong recommendation against surgery.
How this guideline was created A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines and the GRADE system. The recommendation is based on two linked systematic reviews on (a) the benefits and harms of subacromial decompression surgery and (b) the minimally important differences for patient reported outcome measures. Recommendations are made actionable for clinicians and their patients through visual overviews. These provide the relative and absolute benefits and harms of surgery in multilayered evidence summaries and decision aids available in MAGIC (www.magicapp.org) to support shared decisions and adaptation.
The evidence Surgery did not provide important improvements in pain, function, or quality of life compared with placebo surgery or other options. Frozen shoulder may be more common with surgery.
Understanding the recommendation The panel concluded that almost all informed patients would choose to avoid surgery because there is no benefit but there are harms and it is burdensome. Subacromial decompression surgery should not be offered to patients with SAPS. However, there is substantial uncertainty in what alternative treatment is best.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.arthro.2021.05.019},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to investigate trends in the United States for arthroscopic subacromial decompression (aSAD) and open SAD (oSAD) with and without rotator cuff repair (RCR) between 2010 and 2018.
METHODS: The PearlDiver Mariner claims database was queried using CPT codes for open and arthroscopic subacromial decompression and rotator cuff repair. Patient cohorts were developed for those undergoing aSAD or oSAD between 2010 and 2018, then segmented by whether RCR was performed simultaneously. Annual incidence was analyzed, as were associated diagnosis codes, and concomitant shoulder-associated procedures performed on the same day.
RESULTS: The PearlDiver Mariner dataset from 2010 to 2018 included 186,932 patients that underwent aSAD, while 9,263 patients underwent oSAD. The total incidence of aSAD declined from 118.0 to 71.3 per 100,000 (39.6\% decrease) (P {\textless} .001). This change was due primarily to a decreasing incidence of aSAD performed without RCR, which declined from 66.3 to 25.5 per 100,000 (61.5\% decrease) (P {\textless} .001). During the same period, the incidence of aSAD combined with RCR remained relatively stable, from 51.7 to 45.8 per 100,000 (11.5\% decrease) (P = .27). The overall incidence of oSAD declined from 7.1 to 2.2 per 100,000 (68.1\% decrease) (P {\textless} .001).
CONCLUSION: The overall rate of aSAD has declined in recent years, primarily due to a large decrease in the incidence of aSAD without RCR as an isolated treatment for rotator cuff disorders.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Prior studies have demonstrated a rising incidence of SAD; however, high-level clinical evidence and clinical practice guidelines have challenged its efficacy. It is important for orthopaedic surgeons to understand evolving national trends in management among their peers.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop a prospectively applicable method for classifying comorbid conditions which might alter the risk of mortality for use in longitudinal studies. A weighted index that takes into account the number and the seriousness of comorbid disease was developed in a cohort of 559 medical patients. The 1-yr mortality rates for the different scores were: "0", 12\% (181); "1-2", 26\% (225); "3-4", 52\% (71); and "greater than or equal to 5", 85\% (82). The index was tested for its ability to predict risk of death from comorbid disease in the second cohort of 685 patients during a 10-yr follow-up. The percent of patients who died of comorbid disease for the different scores were: "0", 8\% (588); "1", 25\% (54); "2", 48\% (25); "greater than or equal to 3", 59\% (18). With each increased level of the comorbidity index, there were stepwise increases in the cumulative mortality attributable to comorbid disease (log rank chi 2 = 165; p less than 0.0001). In this longer follow-up, age was also a predictor of mortality (p less than 0.001). The new index performed similarly to a previous system devised by Kaplan and Feinstein. The method of classifying comorbidity provides a simple, readily applicable and valid method of estimating risk of death from comorbid disease for use in longitudinal studies. Further work in larger populations is still required to refine the approach because the number of patients with any given condition in this study was relatively small.},
